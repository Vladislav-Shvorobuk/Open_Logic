              Mark Rock believes this will “fundamentally change the nature of how
              audio is captured and then distributed on the Internet.” Clearly this
              will give audioboo a lot of potential for scale compared to competitors
              like SoundCloud and Cinch who continue to rely on user-generated growth.

            SoundCloud recently entered into the spoken word space, technically 
            the “patch” of Audioboo. Audioboo was technically the first in 2009 
            to make voice “social” but it’s been joined by others like Broadcastr, 
            Cinch and also iPadio, though iPadio is more enterprise focused. 
            However, Soundcloud’s music focus has given it an impressive range of
            features in manipulating sound, while Audioboo has concentrated on 
            dealing with broadcasters and media martners.s “in a couple of weeks”
